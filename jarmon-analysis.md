The topic of my analysis project will focus solely on The Delta Light Railways Ltd. I was particularly interested in this idea because of how frequent it was inserted in the newspaper as a means of transportation for people to use. More often, The Delta Light Railways transportation system has some distinctions and similarities to other transportation systems used during that time, like the Egyptian Railroad, Alexandra Tramway, and even the Ramleh Railway Co. Significantly different from the others, there were different measured assessed within the template which helped to provide cohesiveness within this time period of history. 

The Egyptian Gazette was founded in 1880 as a four-page weekly tabloid in Alexandria by five Britons, including Andrew Philip, as editor, and Moberly Bell, later managing editor of The Times in London.

In the 1930s, Cairo became more important than Alexandria as a news centre and the newspaper's offices were moved to the Egyptian capital on 20 February 1938.

Shortly before World War II, ownership of The Egyptian Gazette passed to the Société Orientale de Publicité (SOP) (English: Eastern Publishing Company), in which Oswald J. Finney, a wealthy British businessman, was the major shareholder. The Egyptian Gazette found itself associated with The Egyptian Mail, another English-language Egyptian newspaper, founded in 1914, and also owned by the SOP. The market was split between the two dailies, with the Mail appearing in the morning, and the Gazette in the evening.

At the end of the war and with the departure of most of the British Army stationed in Egypt, the market for English-language newspapers shrank dramatically. As a result, and as continues to the present day, The Egyptian Gazette is published every day except Tuesdays, when the now-weekly The Egyptian Mail appears.

The Egyptian Delta Light Railways was a 750 mm (2 ft 5 1⁄2 in) gauge Egyptian narrow gauge railway, construction of which began in 1898. The system consisted of one thousand kilometers of lines throughout the Nile Delta region, north of Cairo, to supplement the Egyptian standard gauge network, and not all lines were connected.
The first EDLR locomotives were 35 William Bagnall 4-4-0T steam locomotives, constructed in 1898; followed by eighteen German-made Krauss 2-4-0Ts (see photo above) and sixteen Krauss 0-6-2Ts in 1900; thirty locomotives from Nasmyth, Wilson and Company and The North British Locomotive Company (0-6-4T) in 1907. Later Bagnall supplied additional 2-6-2Ts, which were also delivered to the Kalighat Falta Railway and the Bankura Damodar Railway in India, where they were known as the Delta class. Most of the major cities in Ancient Egypt were located along the banks of the Nile River. As a result, the Egyptians used the Nile for transportation and shipping from very early on. They became experts at building boats and navigating the river.

The Delta Light Railways was established many years before today's modern time period within society. As historical text date information back to this specific topic, the Delta Light Railways generated a huge source of income. Relating back to June 26, 1907, the gross earning at the end of March amounted to $250,000. This was much more expected than what they originally thought they would gain from their annual revenue. This was due to the several vast locations where the transportation system was placed throughout the area for people to travel for their convenience.  

Much of what the Egyptians needed they had in their own country. Grain was generally plentiful and in Roman times Egypt was an important wheat growing area for the city of Rome. Beer, a less potent brew than its modern counterpart, was the daily drink of the people. Wine on the other hand was imported for a long time until vineyards were planted in the Delta and some of the oases. Bricks for building houses and palaces were made from the Nile mud, rocks for tombs and temples were found close to the Nile. Natron for embalming and salt were mined locally; flax and hemp grown for making clothes and ropes. Oil for lighting was pressed from the kikki seeds and later from olives. Papyrus grew abundantly in the Delta and was made into a kind of paper.

The alternatives were the routes crossing the Eastern and Western Desert. These caravan routes through the Negev and the Libyan Desert were impossible to interrupt and difficult to administer. Even during the times when Egypt was nominally in power in theses regions and sent officials there, their very distance from the central authority gave them an independence they often abused.
How lucrative this desert trade was can be concluded from the rich tombs recently uncovered at Dakhleh and Baharie. Impressive mastabas were built by Egyptian officials during the reign of Pepi II, when corruption was rife. During the Middle Kingdom, when the central power was weak, trade with Crete flourished. Wall paintings at Knossos and Phaistos depict African slaves, ostrich eggs and ivory. Ahmose reaffirmed Egyptian control over the desert regions, and during most of the New Kingdom the borders were patrolled by frontier police using dogs.

While extracting my data from the table, I closely viewed some important variables. In the Delta Light Railways table, Coaching Services along with Goods & Sundries provided me with the most information. The data was observed from the time period of April 1904 until April 1907.

In the beginning of the data table, there was a decline in the sales of the Delta Light Railways. This is partially due to the inactivity of the use of this specific transportation. Around the time of May 1904, the graph did not correlate with direct activity between Goods and Sundries and Coaching. This could be due to a decline of slow events around the time of Egypt and seasonal events. With the decline of events, there was also a steady decline in the financial aspect as well.
